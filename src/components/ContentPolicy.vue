		<p class="para">
			The rules here are pretty relaxed, so please read the entire content policy before posting.
			The bottom line is that you cannot upload/post anything that's illegal under United States law.
			<br/>That includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Nothing copyrighted</li>
				<li>No violent threats or threats in general</li>
				<li><b>I don't care if you're joking, the law can't tell</b></i>
				<li>While there is no law governing hate speech in the US, it is still illegal to make threats to a group of people.</li>
			</ul>
			All content that does not abide by this policy will be deleted without prior notice.<br>
			Users disregarding these rules is what causes discussion boards to be shutdown.
